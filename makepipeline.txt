sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline
Parameters:
*stepslist of Estimator objects
List of the scikit-learn estimators that are chained together.

memorystr or object with the joblib.Memory interface, default=None
Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. The last step will never be cached, even if it is a transformer. By default, no caching is performed. If a string is given, it is the path to the caching directory. Enabling caching triggers a clone of the transformers before fitting. Therefore, the transformer instance given to the pipeline cannot be inspected directly. Use the attribute named_steps or steps to inspect estimators within the pipeline. Caching the transformers is advantageous when fitting is time consuming.

verbosebool, default=False
If True, the time elapsed while fitting each step will be printed as it is completed.

Returns:
pPipeline
Returns a scikit-learn Pipeline object.


Examples

>>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
>>> from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
>>> from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
>>> make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), GaussianNB(priors=None))
Pipeline(steps=[('standardscaler', StandardScaler()),
                ('gaussiannb', GaussianNB())])
